# MyNotes

This web application allows you to create and manage your notes with ease. In addition to the basic note-taking functionality, this application also allows you to customize the background image of your notes.

To use the application, simply navigate to the URL where you uploaded the MyNotes folder. You will see the home page, where you can create a new note or view existing notes.

To change the background image of the page, simply click on the "Change Background" button. This will change a new background image randomly.
